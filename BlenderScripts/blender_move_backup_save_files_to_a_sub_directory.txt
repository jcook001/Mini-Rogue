Script found here https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6940/config-blender-to-save-backup-files-in-subfolder

"Simply save the code below into a file called something .py [...]

Then import the file by clicking: File > User Preferences > Addons > Install From File... > Finally select the file and activate the addon."

That script didn't work but Chat GPT updated the script for me which is what is saved in this folder.
